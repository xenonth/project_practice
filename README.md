JAVASCRIPT FILE SETUP: ESSENTIAL
The first thing to do is enter the $(document).ready(function(){.....will enter the JQuery inside these brackets} statement as all JQuery must be contained within this statement.


ESTABLISH VARIABLES AND ASSIGN THEIR VALUE/TYPE
The html has buttons and ids established for the calculator numbers of 0 to 9 and operators to perform the mathematical functions.
The javascript file therefore requires:
    (a) Each number to be declared as a constant and a number (not a string). Once we establish the code for a number, it can be replicated and just change the number assigned.
    (b) Each operator to be declared as a constant and the operation it performs viz:
        + (add);
        - (minus);
        * (multiply);
        ^ (to the power of),;
        / (divide).
        Once we establish the code for one operator, it can be replicated and just change the operator assigned.
